## Let's prove it by using the taylor series expansion



# Proof Using Taylor Series Expansion

Consider the function \( f(t) = (1 + t)^n \).

### Step 1: Taylor Series Expansion

The Taylor series expansion of \( f(t) \) around \( t = 0 \) is given by:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} t^k
$$

### Step 2: Compute the Derivatives

First, we need to compute the \( k \)-th derivative of \( f(t) = (1 + t)^n \).

Using the chain rule and power rule, the \( k \)-th derivative of \( (1 + t)^n \) is:

$$
f^{(k)}(t) = \frac{d^k}{dt^k} (1 + t)^n = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} (1 + t)^{n-k}
$$

Evaluating this at \( t = 0 \):

$$
f^{(k)}(0) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

### Step 3: Substitute into the Taylor Series

Substitute the \( k \)-th derivative into the Taylor series expansion:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} t^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{k!} t^k
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!} t^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} t^k
$$

Since \( f(t) = (1 + t)^n \), we have:

$$
(1 + t)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} t^k
$$

### Step 4: Apply to \( (x + y)^n \)

Consider the original binomial expression \( (x + y)^n \). To apply the series expansion, we can write:

$$
(x + y)^n = x^n \left(1 + \frac{y}{x}\right)^n
$$

Using the series expansion of \( (1 + t)^n \) with \( t = \frac{y}{x} \):

$$
\left(1 + \frac{y}{x}\right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^k
$$

Multiplying both sides by \( x^n \):

$$
x^n \left(1 + \frac{y}{x}\right)^n = x^n \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^k
$$

$$
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^n \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k
$$

### Conclusion

This proof correctly uses the Taylor series expansion of \( (1 + t)^n \), and by substituting \( t = \frac{y}{x} \), it shows that the expansion of \( (x + y)^n \) is exactly:

$$
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k
$$

Thus, the Binomial Theorem is proven using the method of Taylor series expansion. This method is indeed correct and valid.
